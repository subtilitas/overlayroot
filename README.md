# overlayroot
mounts an overlay filesystem over the root filesystem

I use this for my Raspberry Pi, but it should work on any Debian or derivative.

The root file system on the sd-card is mounted read-only on /overlay/lower, and / is a
read-write copy on write overlay.

It uses initramfs. Stock Raspbian doesn't use one so step one would be to get initramfs working. 
Something like:

```bash
sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/init.gz
```

Add to /boot/config.txt
```bash

echo "initramfs init.gz" >> /boot/config.txt

```

Test the initramfs works by rebooting. It should boot as normal.

Add the following line to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
```
echo "overlay" >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
```

Copy the following files
```bash
cp hooks-overlay /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/
cp init-bottom-overlay /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/

```
install busybox
```bash
sudo apt-get install busybox
```

then rerun

```bash
sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/init.gz
```

add to .bashrc

```bash
echo '
if [ ! -z "${IMCHROOTED}" ]; then
        PS1="chroot(${IMCHROOTED})\w:# "
fi
' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```

After rebooting, the root filesystem should be an overlay. If it's on tmpfs any changes 
made will be lost after a reboot. If you want to upgrade packages, for example,
run `rootwork`, the prompt should change to
```bash
chroot(/overlay/lower)/:#
```

You're now making changes to the sdcard, and changes will be permanent.

I use `rootwork` to work on the real root filesystem.
I put it in ~/bin and add ~/bin to my path.

The /run directory is problematic to umount, so atm `rootwork` --rbind mounts it
on the sd-card root file system, /overlay/lower, and it isn't umounted like /boot 
/proc /sys and /dev are.

After you've finished working on the sd-card run `exit`. `rootwork` tries to clean up 
by umounting all the mounts it mounted and remount /overlay/lower read-only, but 
often it can't due to an open file or something else causing the filesystem to be busy.
It's probably a good idea to reboot now for 2 reasons:
 
- leaving /overlay/lower read-write could cause file corruption on power loss. 
- to test it still boots ok after the changes you've just made.

Whenever the kernel is updated you need to rerun 

```bash
sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/init.gz
```

TODO: see if there's a hook to automatically run `sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/init.gz` 
on kernel install

There are comments in some of the files you might want to read
and that's about it.
